# Advent of Code 2025

This year, I have decided to use javascript and other skills I have learned from The Odin Project (TOP) to complete the challenges. Right now, my progress in TOP is 25% completed in Javascript course.
This README file will be a place where I log the skills that I used and learned for AOC 2025
ENJOY!

## General

- Webpack to bundle all different javascript files together

## Day 1

- parseInt ()
- slice()
- utilization of modulus

## Day 2

- charAt()
- at()

## Day 3

- map() with a function of two arguments
- use array constructor to initialize the size
- use array fill() function to initialize the array values

## Reflection

- Use javascript for the DOM elements instead of hardcoding everything in the HTML file (especially because some of these elements have repetitive structure)
